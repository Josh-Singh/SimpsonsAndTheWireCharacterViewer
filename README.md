# SimpsonsAndTheWireCharacterViewer
This app shows the characters of Simpsons and The Wire based on the target selected

An XCode issue occurs sometimes when running the target meant for The Wire characters, saying that the app could not be installed at this time.
This issue is fixed by following these steps:
Reset the simulator:

Hardware -> Erase All content and settings...

Clean your project:

shift+cmd+K

shift+opt+cmd+K

This should fix your issue
